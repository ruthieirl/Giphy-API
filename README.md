#### HTML * CSS * JavaScript * jQuery * APIs


-----------------------------------------


## What is it?

This application was an exercise demonstrating understanding of jQuery and APIs.


## How To Use

The user will find a screen with buttons and a search bar. When a button is clicked, a series of gifs will appear relevant to what the button says. A user can also add a new button by typing in the search bar and hitting submit.

This particular page is Tim Burton themed.  All of the buttons are Tim Burton Movie Titles.

A screen shot of the game can be seen below:
