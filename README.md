# Giphy-API

#### HTML * CSS * JavaScript * jQuery * APIs


-----------------------------------------


## What is it?

This application was an exercise demonstrating understanding of jQuery and APIs.


## How To Use

The user will find a screen with buttons and a search bar. When a button is clicked, a series of gifs will appear relevant to what the button says. When the gifs appear, they will be still images. Once the image is clicked, the gif will animate.  Another click, and the gif will be still again. A user can also add a new button by typing in the search bar and hitting submit. That new button can be clicked to view new gifs.

This particular page is Tim Burton themed.  All of the buttons are Tim Burton Movie Titles.

A screen shot of the game can be seen below:
